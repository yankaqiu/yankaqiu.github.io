Recently I came across a paper with a strangely quiet, almost dangerous idea:
“Talent vs Luck: The Role of Randomness in Success and Failure.”
I didn’t expect it to stir anything in me. And yet, it did.

For so long, I held onto the comforting belief that talent, intelligence, and endless hard work would eventually pay off. That life was, in some hidden way, fair. That if I just tried a little harder, got a little better, pushed a little further, success would be waiting somewhere down the road.

But this paper whispered a different story—one that felt both unsettling and strangely relieving.

------

The authors built a little universe inside a computer. A tiny world with little people wandering inside a box, bumping into green dots and red ones.
Green meant luck. Red meant misfortune. 

The red dots cut their success in half, but the green dots doubled it, proportional to their talent, since more talented people tend to be better at capitalizing on the opportunities that luck presents. This actually reflects a realistic nuance: while bad luck often affects everyone equally, the ability to capitalize on good luck depends on one’s talent, skills, and preparedness.

Talent was there too, distributed gently along a bell curve, the way we imagine human gifts to be sprinkled across the world. But what fascinated me was how the story unfolded: the talented didn’t always rise, and the ordinary didn’t always fall. Sometimes the opposite happened.

Someone average would hit a string of green dots and rise spectacularly.
Someone brilliant would collide with red dots again and again, and quietly sink.

And the distribution of “success” in this simulated world—just like the world we live in—became wildly uneven. A few soared; most remained where they started. The familiar shape of inequality emerged, not from merit, but from randomness.

What haunted me most was this simple observation:
The most successful were rarely the most talented.
They were the luckiest.

Somehow, that truth feels both brutal and liberating.

------

We live in a culture obsessed with effort.
Work harder. Grind more. Optimize everything.
All your life you’ve been told that effort equals outcome.
That results are reflections of your worth. That failure means you didn’t try hard enough.

But what if—what if—you did everything right, and the world simply didn’t open?
What if the door you knocked on was locked not because of you,
but because it just wasn’t your door?

The simulated worlds revealed success wasn’t a straight road built from talent.
It was a random walk:

There’s a kind of gentleness in acknowledging that life is not entirely under our control.
A softness in letting go of that constant pressure to justify our existence through achievement.

Imagine a god leaning close and telling you:
“It’s okay. This wasn’t your fault. This time, luck just didn’t land on you.”
Wouldn’t that make you breathe a little easier?
Wouldn’t that loosen something tight in your chest?

I guess it would.

So what should we do with this knowledge?
Not surrender. Not stop trying.
But maybe—stop punishing ourselves. At least, it helps me to relieve some stress. 

Luck is unpredictable, but we can invite it by stepping into the world more often.
Reading widely. Meeting new people. Pursuing curiosities.
Saying yes to something slightly frightening.
Trying things even when we’re unsure.

Every attempt is a chance for a green dot to appear.
Every effort is another roll of the dice.

And when the red dots come—and they will—we might remember that misfortune is not always a mirror reflecting our worth. Sometimes it’s just the randomness of the universe brushing against our path.

------

And somehow, admitting this makes life feel less like a relentless test
and more like a journey we are allowed to experience without fear.

Maybe that’s the quiet gift of this paper:
Not cynicism, but comfort.
Not resignation, but a reason to try gently, bravely, and more often.

After all, if life depends so much on chance…
why not open yourself to more of it?

And why not forgive yourself a little more, for the times when the universe simply rolled the dice in someone else’s favor? (ok so this is the question for myself)
