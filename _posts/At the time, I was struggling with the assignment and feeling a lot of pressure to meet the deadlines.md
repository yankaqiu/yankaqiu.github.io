At the time, I was struggling with the assignment and feeling a lot of pressure to meet the deadlines. I tend to rely heavily on solving problems by myself and often hesitate to ask for help, even when I’m stuck. I realize now that this approach is not always effective and can lead to poor decisions, as it did in this case. 



Thank you for asking. I take full responsibility for my actions, and I deeply regret that I’ve made the same mistake a second time. After reflecting on this incident, I realized that my tendency to solve problems on my own without seeking help was a key factor. When I struggled with the assignment, I felt overwhelmed and didn’t manage my time properly. Instead of reaching out to my professor or classmates for guidance, I took a shortcut, which I now know was completely unacceptable.”

One of my biggest challenges is that I tend to overthink problems and try to solve everything on my own. I realize now that this stems from a reluctance to ask for help, as I wanted to appear like I could handle everything by myself. This mindset has not only limited my learning but also led to mistakes like the one I’m facing now. I understand the importance of seeking guidance and collaboration, and I’m committed to changing this habit moving forward.”



​	“This second mistake has been a wake-up call for me. I’ve come to understand that asking for help is not a weakness, but a valuable resource for learning. To prevent this from happening again, I’ve already started working on improving my time management and actively seeking help when I encounter challenges. I’ve also been reviewing ETH’s academic integrity guidelines to ensure I fully understand and adhere to the standards.”



This situation has been a significant source of stress for me, but it has also pushed me to reflect deeply and grow from the experience.”

This incident has truly made me reflect deeply on my actions and my approach to challenges. I’ve realized that I’ve been a bit impetuous and rushed in my decision-making. I genuinely hope to have the opportunity to continue improving myself and prove that I’ve learned from this experience.



​	“Thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn from this experience. I will take this lesson seriously and make sure that I uphold ETH’s standards in the future.”



“May I ask if there is any possibility for reconsideration? I am fully committed to learning from this experience and taking corrective actions.”
