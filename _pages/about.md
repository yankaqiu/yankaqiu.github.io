I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree at ETH Zurich & EPFL major in CyberSecurity, with a minor in Machine Intelligence. My primary interest lies in the  **AI Security and Privacy**, I’m passionate about exploring how to safeguard systems in an ever-evolving digital landscape. I have a keen interest in exploring how the Universe and Intelligence work and how can we possibly understand them. My long-term goal is to embrace the AGI via fully explainable methods!


Outside of academics, I’m an avid sports enthusiast. I enjoy **bouldering**, **working out**, and **swimming**, and I also love reading and watching movies. I try to write silly posts and some techinical staff here. :)
