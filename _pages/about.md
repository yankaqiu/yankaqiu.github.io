I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree at ETH Zurich major in CyberSecurity. My primary interest lies in the  **AI Security** and cutting-edge technologies, where I explore how to safeguard systems in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

Outside of academics, I’m an avid sports enthusiast. I enjoy **bouldering**, **working out**, and **swimming**, along with exploring other activities that challenge both the mind and body.  I try to write silly posts and some techinical staff here. :)
